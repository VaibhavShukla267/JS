Java Script is Synchronus and single threaded.

Synchronus means ek code execute hoga fir ek aur code execute hoga. and soo on.......
and single threaded means ek hi thread pe sab execute hoga
since javascript is found in runtime environment so it works perfectly with single threaded

********************************************

Execution Context:Each operations waits for the last one to complete before executing..

Blocking Code Vs Non Blocking Code
i.e Synchronus and Asynchronus. 

Blocking Code:Block The flow Of whole program & And read the file sync

Non blocking code:Does Not Block Executuion And Read file Async...

Its not like that non blocking code is always correct but if we take example that when a user wants to register in a portal....If code goes to non blocking code it will print registration succesful even registration is not complete.....

But if code goes blocking code it first stops the flow of particular code and interprets the operations needed by user then completes it and give user successful registration message.

Understanding Events Loops

In Js Engine,call stack is build  where a global and functions are loaded and when work is done they are unloaded.and memory is also build where we can see how memory is stored in memory.

We have web ApI like for eg:we apply set timeout in fucntion of call stack.after setting it the set timeout will register itself to register call back.

All the register call back are stored in task queues so that after completing a particular call back it adds back to call stack. 

for eg if print 1 then 2 the  3. if we set timeout (0,2) on 2 it will first 1 then 3 then 3 since its passing throuh whole above process .so it takes time not soo  much but a bit...

One to remember is fetch() api it has its own task queue which is a high priority queue that stores promises
